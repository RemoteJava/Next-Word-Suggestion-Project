Next Word Suggestion

This document explains how my project predicts text.

Text prediction is used to suggest words to a user who is typing.
To use my text prediction program, the user will type in one of three words and the program will predict which word comes next.

The three word choices are "to", "sounds", and "if".
When you type one of the words, one of the suggested words should appear.
